Improved resource loading by using the context classloader as fallback for the resource lookup (e.g. in StreamUtils) 

Added TransactionManager#hasBeenMarkedRollbackOnly(): boolean. Follows JTA semantics

Added StaleTransactionException. All AbstractResourceConsumer sub-classes that handle transactional 
resources will throw this, if they detect that the current unit of work has been marked rollback only
after they finish their work

Added AbstractResourceConsumer#checkTransactionHealth(WorkerExecutionDetails details) throws StaleTransactionException : void for convenience

Bo2 will not treat StaleTransactionExceptions specially, other than checking the cause chain before 
throwing a CouldNotRollbackException in order to provide a more helpful message for debug purposes

Affected AbstractResourceConsumer sub-classes:

AbstractHibernatePersistenceUtility
AbstractHibernateQuery
AbstractJdbcWorker
