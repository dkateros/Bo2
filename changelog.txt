Added Bo2Quartz


Users may schedule jobs associated with a specific unit of work using

+ AbstractBo2RuntimeCommand#schedule(JobDescription description) : void (batch)
+ Bo2WicketRequestCycle#schedule(JobDescription description) : void (web)

The scheduled jobs are submitted to the scheduler if and only if the UOW commits successfully.
